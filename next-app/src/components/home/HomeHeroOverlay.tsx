              At clamp(2.4rem, 8vw, 5.75rem) in a min(92vw, 52rem) box, measured
              line counts are: ~26-29 characters = 2 lines at every width (the
              profile this page has always had), 38 characters = 3 lines at both
              320px and 1280px+, 48 characters = 4 lines. Re-measure before
              lengthening; the full page title will NOT fit here.

              KEYWORDS, deliberately — location + both primary categories + buyer
              intent, in the one slot Google reads as the page's topic. The owner's
              stated priority (2026-08-16) is that the strongest signal on the site
              is that we BUY in Naples, and this is the only element that can carry
              it with heading weight.

              A brand-voice draft ("Pieces Worth Discovering") held this slot
              briefly and was reverted for exactly that reason. Its trade-off is
              worth remembering if the question comes round again: warmer copy, but
              the homepage then had no on-page topic signal at all.

              ⚠️ At 46 characters this is well past the ~29-char two-line budget.
              The headline block was widened to 72rem so it renders TWO lines on
              desktop; it is still THREE at phone and tablet widths, where 92vw
              binds before the cap. Accepted. Re-measure on any rewording and do
              not assume a line count — it now differs by breakpoint.

              ⚠️ Since 2026-09-13 the size also depends on window HEIGHT: on a
              short window the CSS fit shrinks this so it clears the sign-up
              form. That fit hardcodes this wording's measured widths (23.5 and
              12.6 in the headline fit rule below) — a longer headline needs them
              re-measured, or it can wrap onto a line the fit did not budget for.

              ⚠️ "Premier", not "Premiere" — the latter means a debut performance.
              `/silver-services` uses the same correct form; do not let a
              well-meaning edit reintroduce the typo in the site's largest text.

              ⚠️ One test survives every rewrite: hero copy must never imply the
              visitor should ALREADY know what they have. "Know What Yours Is
              Worth" was rejected for exactly that — most arrive holding something
              inherited and unidentified. */}

           The limits are HERO heights, one table per headline language
           (COMPACT_BANDS_EN / COMPACT_BANDS_ES at the top of this file — each
           page renders only its own). Each was set from a sweep of the live
           page at the tallest window where the previous layout was tight
           (under 16px) or overlapping and below the first height where it
           fit, so nothing that fit gains compact mode. The two headlines wrap
           differently only on narrow phones, which is why the tables differ
           there and match from 431px up. Narrow widths that were not measured
           keep the neighbouring limit that cannot change a fitting screen.

           ⚠️ A container query on the overlay, never a max-height media query:
           the overlay height comes from the frozen --app-vh, while a media
           query follows the live window height, which a mobile toolbar moves
           mid-scroll — the hero would flip modes while the visitor scrolls.
           Source order matters: these must stay after every rule they
           override, including the phone fit above. */
