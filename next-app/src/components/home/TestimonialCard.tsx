 * it was lifted out of the section: a review must look and link the same
 * wherever it appears, and the "Read on Google" link is part of that.
 *
 * `isRepeat` marks a duplicate rendered only to fill the loop. Those are
 * hidden from assistive tech and taken out of the tab order — a screen reader
 * reading the same four reviews four times would be worse than not having the
 * band — and CSS removes them entirely under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
