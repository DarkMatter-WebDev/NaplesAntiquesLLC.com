// Scroll-pinned hero stack. The page appears to stand still while the user
// scrolls: a sticky, overflow-hidden frame pins the hero below the header, and
// scroll progress drives the slideshow layers inside it. Only the SLIDESHOWS
// move. There are THREE of them and they hand over in sequence: A slides UP and
// away while B RISES FROM BELOW to take its place, and B is already sliding up
// and away while C rises behind it — the two crossings OVERLAP, so the hero
// never stops moving mid-handover. C holds until the runway ends.
// EVERYTHING travels upward, so the hero reads as one continuous scroll
// (owner request 2026-08-06 — this replaced an arrangement where arriving panes
// descended from above; do not restore that from older comments elsewhere).
// The headline, sign-up form, and CTA buttons live in a separate, pinned overlay
// layer that stays exactly where it is throughout. When the runway ends the
// sticky frame (slideshows + overlay together) releases and scrolls away
// naturally with the rest of the page.
//
// The arriving pane slightly OVERLAPS the departing one (PANE_A_TRAVEL below
// 100), and both crossings are EASED, so a pane decelerates into its lock rather
// than stopping dead. Both are load-bearing for how the handover reads — see
// those constants.
//
// Transforms are written imperatively per scroll frame (no React re-renders).
// A slideshow pane is `inert` only while it is fully offscreen, so exactly the
// visible ring's cards are clickable — and it is also `paused` then, which stops
// its carousel's ring animation and per-frame sampler (the carousel's own
// IntersectionObserver cannot detect this inside the pinned frame). The
// overlay's light/dark text theme follows whichever slideshow currently
// dominates the frame. prefers-reduced-motion collapses the runway to the frame
// height via CSS — no travel, no pin, panes B and C hidden — restoring the
// original static hero.

//   0             -> PHASE_1_END   crossing A -> B
//   PHASE_2_START -> PHASE_2_END   crossing B -> C  (starts BEFORE the first ends)
// The two crossings share the band PHASE_2_START..PHASE_1_END, during which both
// clocks run.
//
// There is NO hold anywhere, including at the end: PHASE_2_END is exactly 1, so
// C reaches flush on the same frame the runway ends and the sticky frame
// unpins (owner, 2026-08-06: no pause at the third carousel before scrolling on).
// That also means C's ease-out and the page starting to scroll away coincide, so
// on-screen motion is continuous — as C's own travel decelerates to zero the
// whole frame begins moving instead.
//
// NOTE the phases OVERLAP: PHASE_2_START is BEFORE PHASE_1_END, so the
// second crossing is already under way while the first finishes. That is
// deliberate (owner, 2026-08-06: "overlap the crossings so it never stops").
// There is no hold between them at all — B sweeps through flush rather than
// resting there, and the frame is never motionless mid-hero.
//
// TWO INVARIANTS, both fixed 2026-08-06 after the owner reported the handovers
// feeling uneven and still slightly paused.
//
// 1. THE CROSSINGS MUST BE THE SAME LENGTH. They were 0.47 and 0.54 — crossing
//    two ran 15% longer, so the two handovers moved at different speeds and the
//    spacing between slideshows visibly changed from one to the next ("dynamic
//    distance between the first, second and third"). Equal lengths make every
//    handover identical.
//
// 2. THE OVERLAP RATIO SETS HOW MUCH THE MOTION DIPS AT THE HANDOVER, and the
//    reason is not obvious: smoothstep's derivative is ZERO AT BOTH ENDS. Butting
//    the crossings would hand over from a term decelerating to zero to one
//    accelerating from zero, so the velocity still touches nothing. Overlapping
//    fixes that, but only as far as the ratio allows — at 0.20 the incoming
//    crossing is still on the flat part of its curve (slope 0.97 of a possible
//    1.50, ~65%) and the dip was still perceptible. At 0.36 it is 1.38/1.50,
//    ~92%, so the handover barely slows at all.
//
// Keep `(PHASE_1_END - PHASE_2_START) / (PHASE_2_END - PHASE_2_START)` near 0.36
// and both crossing lengths equal. Raising the ratio further starts the next
// slideshow before the current one has really arrived; lowering it brings the
// pause back.
// Solved, not guessed: pinning PHASE_2_END at 1 while holding both invariants
// (equal crossing lengths L, overlap ratio 0.36) gives L = 1/1.64 = 0.61, hence
// PHASE_1_END = 0.61 and PHASE_2_START = 1 - 0.61 = 0.39. Overlap 0.22, ratio
// 0.361, handover slope 1.38/1.50 = 92%. Re-solve the same way if the ratio or
// the end point ever move.

// How far the DEPARTING pane travels, as a percentage of one frame height, over
// the same scroll in which the arriving pane travels exactly 100%. The arriving
// travel is FIXED — offscreen at rest, exactly flush when it locks — so this
// constant is the only control over the seam.
//
// The seam is `t * (PANE_A_TRAVEL - 100)`:
//   > 100  departing pane outruns the arriving one, leaving a real GAP of open
//          frame between them (the backdrop shows through).

// Lowered 100 -> 95 -> 85 across 2026-08-06 as the owner asked for the join to
// keep tightening ("I can see transitions"). At 85 the arriving pane overlaps
// the departing one by ~15% of a frame (~180px at 1200px).
//
// Two things that overlap buys, and both matter to how visible the join is:
//   - the arriving pane's feathered top edge fades over the departing pane's
//     REAL PHOTOGRAPH rather than out to backdrop, so there is no pale band;
//   - it guarantees the two panes genuinely share a band, which is what lets the
//     seam feathers (A_EXIT_DISSOLVE_PCT, B_ARRIVE_FEATHER_PCT) run wide enough
//     to stop the boundary reading as a line.
//
// The departing pane never clears the frame at 85 — it stops 15% short — which
// is only safe because the arriving pane is flush and higher in the stack by
// then. Frame coverage is verified across the whole runway after every change to
// this constant, never assumed.

// an arriving pane's ring any further and it pokes into frame while the pane is
// still parked below at rest — which bottoms out at ~75% separation, just short
// of touching.
//
// So the pull PEAKS MID-CROSSING and is zero at both ends: `4e(1 - e)` is 0 at

// designed and nothing peeks; only while a crossing is actually happening do the

// Why: the departing pane only travels PANE_A_TRAVEL (85%), so late in a
// crossing the part of it still inside the frame is its bottom ~15% — and its
// ring left the top of the frame long before, so that strip is EMPTY backdrop.
// Measured at p=0.50: pane A's bottom sat at 25.6% while pane B's top was still
// at 8%, leaving an 8%-tall band of blank black at the top of the frame, fully
// opaque. Against an arriving white slideshow that reads as a hard black bar
// rather than as a photograph leaving (owner, 2026-08-07).
//
// Fading the tail dissolves that band instead of sliding it out. It starts late
// so the overlap still does its job for most of the crossing: the arriving
// pane's feathered top edge blends over a SOLID photograph while it matters, and
// only the empty remainder fades.
// Raised 0.4 -> 0.65 -> 0.75 (owner, 2026-08-07: start it sooner so the leaving
// slideshow is nearly invisible by the time its empty tail is the only thing
// left). A LONGER tail means the fade STARTS EARLIER, so opacity is lower by the
// time the exposed strip appears: where the black bar used to sit it measures
// ~0.11, against 1.00 before any of this.
//
// The cost, accepted deliberately: the departing slideshow is already
// part-transparent mid-crossing while a third of it is still on screen (~0.42 at
// p=0.40), so the handover reads as a CROSSFADE rather than one layer sliding
// over another. That is the intended look now, not a bug. Much past this the
// outgoing slideshow starts dissolving while it is still the main thing on
// screen, which becomes a different effect rather than a cleaner version of this
// one.
// 2026-08-08: 0.75 was TOO MUCH, and the reason is worth keeping.
//
// Opacity applies to the WHOLE pane. Pane A's backdrop is pure black and the
// frame behind it is white, so a partly-transparent pane A does not read as
// "leaving" — it reads as a flat GRAY RECTANGLE. Measured mid-crossing at
// p=0.35: pane A still occupied 27% of the frame at opacity 0.36, compositing
// to a uniform rgb(163,163,163) with the carousel photos washed out inside it.
// Black fading over white passes through every gray on the way; no value of
// this constant avoids that, because the problem is that the fade is applied to
// an AREA rather than to an EDGE.
//
// So the dissolve moved to a spatial one (A_EXIT_DISSOLVE_PCT below) and this
// dropped back to 0.45, where it does the job it is actually good at: taking the
// last of the pane out at the very end. At p=0.35 pane A now sits at ~0.87
// opacity — reading as a photograph, not a smear — and the handover is carried

             The runway is ONLY the scroll budget. It does not change what the
             panes do — each still travels exactly one frame height per crossing
             — so it sets how much SCROLL buys that travel, i.e. the speed of the
             hero under a finger or a wheel. A crossing spans 0.61 of the runway,
             so scroll-per-full-pane-travel is 0.61 x this number: at 110svh that
             was 67svh of scroll for 100svh of pane movement, about 1.5x faster
             than 1:1, and the owner reported it as far too fast on a phone.

             110svh -> 240svh (owner, 2026-08-09: "way too fast, slow it down a
             lot"), giving 146svh of scroll per 100svh of travel — roughly 0.7x,
             comfortably calmer than 1:1 and about 2.2x slower than before. Not
             back to the old 290svh: the hero no longer has to be scrolled by
             hand on touch, since one flick snaps a whole slideshow, so a longer
             runway costs the visitor far less than it did when this was
             compressed on 2026-08-06.

             NOTE this governs the MANUAL drag only. On touch the handover is
             usually driven by the snap, whose speed is SNAP_STEP_MS and is
             independent of this number. Changing one without the other slows
             half the experience.

             not need re-tuning alongside it. */
