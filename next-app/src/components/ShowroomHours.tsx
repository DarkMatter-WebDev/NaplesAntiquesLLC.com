/**
 * Opening hours as a day-then-time list.
 *
 * Replaces `hoursLine()` ("Tue–Sat 11am–3pm, or by appointment") on display
 * surfaces. That single line packs three separate facts — which days, which
 * hours, and that appointments exist — into one run of text, so a reader has to
 * parse a sentence to answer "can I go on Thursday". A two-column list answers
 * it by scanning.
 *
 * Layout notes:
 *
 * - It is a `<dl>`: these are genuinely term/definition pairs, and the markup
 *   should say so for a screen reader rather than faking a table with divs.
 * - The grid is `inline-grid` inside a centering wrapper, so the block shrinks
 *   to its content and centers as a unit while the two columns stay aligned
 *   with each other. A plain centered grid would centre each row individually
 *   and lose the column edge that makes it scannable.
 * - Closed days are dimmed rather than hidden. "Sunday — Closed" is the answer
 *   to a question someone is actually asking; an absent row is not.
 * - **"or by appointment" sits under the list, not beside a row.** It qualifies
 *   every row, so putting it in the time column next to one day would say
 *   something false about that day specifically. A third column would break the
 *   two-column alignment the list exists for.
 *
 * ℹ️ Deliberately does NOT bold "today" the way Google Maps does. Today is a
 * client-side fact — the server renders in its own timezone and these pages are
 * statically prerendered, so a server-rendered "today" would be wrong for real
 * visitors and a client-rendered one would cost a hydration pass on the footer
 * of every page. Not worth it for emphasis.
