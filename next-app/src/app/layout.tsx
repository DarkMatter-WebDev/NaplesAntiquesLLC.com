// The <html>/<body> shell lives in [locale]/layout.tsx so `lang` can reflect the
// locale (en/es). This root layout is a passthrough that only owns global metadata
// and the globals.css import. The root not-found.tsx renders its own <html>.
// Brand FIRST, then the descriptor (owner, 2026-08-15). It previously ran
// "Sell Gold… | Naples Estate Jewelry", and Google routinely drops a trailing
// brand — it already prints the site name on its own line — so the result led
// with "Sell Gold" and never showed who we are. Leading with the brand is the
// one position Google will not strip.
//
// ⚠️ HOMEPAGE ONLY. The `template` below deliberately keeps the brand as a
// SUFFIX for interior pages: prefixing 24 characters there would push the part
// that actually distinguishes the page (a product name, a city) past Google's
// ~60-character display limit.
// "Sterling" was dropped 2026-08-15 to bring this to 65 characters, inside
// Google's ~60-char display so the trailing "in Naples, FL" — the local
// qualifier — stays visible instead of being truncated away. The term is not
// lost: it remains in this page's description, its visible copy, its JSON-LD,
// and in the /sell and /silver-services titles, which are the pages that should
// actually rank for it.
