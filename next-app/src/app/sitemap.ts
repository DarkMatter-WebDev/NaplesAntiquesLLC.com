// Stable last-modified date for content pages. Using a fixed date (bumped when
// page content is meaningfully updated) avoids sending a churning "modified now"
// signal on every crawl, which dilutes the freshness signal for pages that did
// not actually change.
// 2026-09-01: /silver-services crossover lines on bullion, gold-services,
// estate-jewelry, faq, about, trade-in, sell + the homepage's fourth
// services card. Bump this whenever a batch changes page COPY, not for
// doc-only or infrastructure deploys.
// 2026-09-02: three guides added and linked from their parent pages
// (/gold-services, /estate-services, /jewelry-appraisal) and the /sell hub.
// 2026-09-03: /sell/dont-melt-it added (linked from /sell), plus the
// resale-vs-melt hook sentence on the homepage gold card and every city intro.
// 2026-09-05: fifth homepage services card (We Buy Estate Jewelry in Naples)
// and the gold page's lab-testing caption; icon swap alone would not count.
// 2026-09-06: /silver-services gained the illustrated "Reading Silver Marks"
// section and photos in three existing slots; later the same day the section
// moved to its own guide, /silver-services/silver-marks, and the lander was
// reordered around buying. Night: the gold twin, /gold-services/gold-marks,
// plus a teaser on /gold-services and links from the hallmarks page.
